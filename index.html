          For the past 3 years, I have been working as an IT support specialist.

      <p>
           With my experience in IT support is wide and varied,
           including troubleshooting (on and off site),
           Installing and configuring computer hardware, software, system, networks, printer and scanners.

      <br>
      <p>
          I have also provided IT help desk support and have developed excellent interpersonal skills as a result.
          I am particularly skilled in explaining technical issues to people with little or no IT expertise.

      <p>
          However, I would like to further my career.That is why am here in UCLA Extension Coding Boot Camp.
          I would like to learn how to code , to get to know more how to create web application.
